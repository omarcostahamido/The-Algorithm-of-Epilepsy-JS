# The Algorithm of Epilepsy JS
Javascript version of Mauro Pinto's _The Algorithm of Epilepsy_

## Overview
I developped this repo as part of my practice-based research that went into producing the original spatialized music for the theatre play about EEG Epilepsy Seizure Prediction, [_The Algorithm of Epilepsy_](https://marioneteatro.com/en/productions/o-algoritmo-da-epilepsia). It is a javascript version of the original Python code, running on (modern) browsers, in near-realtime.
